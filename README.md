# Traffic sign recognition
The task is to recognize and classify road signs from a general image.

![](readme_files/Final_image.png)

Road signs used in post-Soviet countries were chosen as the target type.

More than 95% of road signs in post-Soviet countries are identical, so you can use this model for any of these countries 
(Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan)

**More details in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_signs_in_post-Soviet_states)**

## Data
The dataset (prepared by myself) contains 200 classes, 117.000 images and was also publicly available on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhailkosov/traffic-signs-in-post-soviet-states-200-classes

The imbalance of classes is explained by the complexity of the structure and the variety of forms of 
road signs, on the one hand, and vice versa - simplicity and uniform on the other hand.

## Training model and evaluation metrics
The dataset was divided in a stratified way (70% train / 15% valid / 15% test): ["Training_model/split_dfs"](Training_model/split_dfs)

## Deployment Inference with Docker
At the moment, it only allows you to compare the final image with segmented road signs and the predictions made 
for each sign (all images are taken from the folders: "Data/segmented_images" and "Data/segmented_signs"

1. Pull the Docker Image:
   * docker pull gurzuff/road_sign_classification:latest
2. Run the Docker Container:
   * docker run --rm -v /local/path:/app/inference_docker gurzuff/road_sign_classification:latest

!Ensure to replace "**/local/path**" with the local directory where you want to store the inference results.

## Segmentation
The [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/main/MODEL_ZOO.md)
(from facebookresearch) was used to segment road signs from general images.

* pip install "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git"
* The pre-trained weights: [detectron2/LVISv0.5-InstanceSegmentation/mask_rcnn_X_101_32x8d_FPN_1x/](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/LVISv0.5-InstanceSegmentation/mask_rcnn_X_101_32x8d_FPN_1x/144219108/model_final_5e3439.pkl)

* ![](readme_files/Segmented_Image.png)

## Environment
For training on a video card, I used [tensorflow-gpu==2.10.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows). To install this library, you must use the following auxiliary tools:
   * [Bazel 5.1.1](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases?q=5.1.1&expanded=true)
   * [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive)
   * [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)

## Next stages of development
0. Expand dockerization
1. Retrain the detectron2 model to improve road sign detection: 
    * Sign "End of the priority road" - not detected;
2. Add a text/character recognition model for more accurate character classification:
    * Sign "Distance to the object" - value ("60Ð¼") not recognized.
